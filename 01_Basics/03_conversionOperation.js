// Operations in java script

console.log(2*2)  //it is the multiplication
console.log(2**2); //it is 2 to the power 2
console.log(2/2); //it is division
console.log(100%9); // % sign is remainder

// Adding the strings

let str1 = "Hello"
let str2 = " Vedant"
let str3 = str1 + str2

console.log(str3);

// Error cases

console.log(1 + 2 + "5") //it will give 35 as numbers are first so it will treat initially as numbers hence it will add first two

console.log("2" + 1 + 8); // it will give 218 as it is initialize with the string
